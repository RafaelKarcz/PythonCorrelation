===========================
Movie Data Analysis Project
===========================

This document provides instructions for setting up the Python environment on a Linux system using Anaconda and Conda, and it outlines the steps for running a detailed data analysis and visualization of a movie dataset, which is available on Kaggle.

Environment Setup
-----------------

1. **Creating a New Conda Environment:**

   To create a new isolated environment for the project:

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda create --name myproject python=3.12

   This command creates a new environment named ``myproject`` with Python 3.12.

2. **Activating the Environment:**

   Activate the created environment with the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda activate myproject

   This ensures that any Python operations or package installations are confined to this environment.

3. **Installing Jupyter Lab:**

   Install Jupyter Lab to work with notebooks and code interactively:

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab

   Jupyter Lab is installed from the Conda-Forge channel.

4. **Starting Jupyter Lab:**

   To launch Jupyter Lab:

   .. code-block:: bash

      jupyter lab

   This command opens Jupyter Lab in the default web browser.

5. **Additional Package Installations:**

   Install additional packages required for data manipulation and visualization:

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda install pandas matplotlib seaborn

Project Execution
-----------------

The core of this project involves analyzing and visualizing data from the `movies.csv` file, which can be downloaded from Kaggle at the following link:

- **Kaggle Dataset:** `https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies`

The Python script processes this data to:

- **Load and clean data:** Handles missing data and corrects data types.
- **Visualize relationships:** Creates scatter plots, strip plots, and correlation matrices.
- **Analyze trends:** Identifies trends and high correlations within the movie industry data.

To run the analysis, navigate to the script in Jupyter Lab and execute the cells sequentially. Ensure the `movies.csv` file is correctly placed in your project directory.
